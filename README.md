### Photo Banners

The photograhic banners are a good idea on life inside of the gym and to give an idea on what is going to be the tasks at hand. the focus of this was that the user would be able to see if thet would enjoy the enviroment of the gym and the idea of using four images was to show the simplicity of change, that it might not be too much to discourage the user from comitting and rather making them feel more inquisitive

Multi site mockup genrated on [Techsini.com](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php)

Site was built on deplyed using [Github](https://github.com/)

The website was built using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control to commit and push code on to deductaed github raspitory

[Google Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used to test responsivness and effectively check what changes necessary in css coding to get desired results.

## Testing

Testing was performed on three different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.
No noticable errors were found in the creation of this site due to its simplistic nature, there was no Mac abailable during testing so Safari fould not be used to enhance the testing procedure

the website was also tested on Android on a Samsung S20 FE and S8 

### Validator Testing

## HTML

The site passes W3C Validator testing on [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

All pages passed with the index.html showing warnings of no headers of h2 - h6 found, otherwise no errors

 
## CSS

The site passes all tests on [CSSjigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/)


## Accessability

Accessability was tested using Lighthouse on Google Developer Tools, passmark 100% achieved on all pages.


### Bugs

- Initially had an issue with mobile device responsivness 
Flexbox was used to sort these issues out and changing widths of original issues

- The CSS was originally located in the assets folder but was moved then caused the site to not load the style sheet, this was fixed when the pathway was redirected to the css folder which has the stylesheet

- The hero image on the home page was too long for smaller devices, and the about text was overlapping, this was changed to fit the hero section in a smaller height

- The services table was too large to fit in the mobile view of the page and was changed when the height of the page was increased

- The contact page could not align well in mobile view, the original flexbox was causing the widths of the input to overflow, the grid system was implemented for ease of the pages structure

- Index owner profile section was too wide for smaller devices, a smaller breakpoint was created to allow content to fit


### Unfixed bugs

- The navbar menu is too small on smaller devices and the Afrikan Beasts Text Link to direct to the home page is  hidden from 500px and smaller, this can be fixed with JavaScript or even frameworks like Bootstrap to create a Hamburger Icon so that the logo can remain and the navigations can be hidden
