        <h3>Olympic Weightlifting, What is it?</h3>
        <p>
            Technically speaking, Olympic Weightlifting, otherwise known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlifting" target="_blank" aria-label="This is a link to the definition of weightlifting, this opens in a new tab"
              >‘Weightlifting’</a
            >
            or
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting" target="_blank" aria-label="This is a link to the definition of olympic weightlifting, this opens up in a new tab"
              >‘Olympic-style Weightlifting’</a
            >
            is one of the oldest sports which incorporates the use of two
            independent lifts which require the athlete to lift a loaded
            barbell from the floor to an overhead position in an explosive
            manner. The two lifts, the ‘Clean & Jerk’ and the ‘Snatch’ are
            explosive movements as they require a combination of maximal
            strength and maximal speed. On the other hand, these exercises and
            their variations are an effective method for enhancing athletic
            performance. Sports that require high-load speed strength such as
            football, volleyball, basketball, and track and field, have all
            been suggested to benefit from the use of Olympic Weightlifting
            because of their biomechanical characteristics of high force and
            power output.
