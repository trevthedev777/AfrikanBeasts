            >‘Olympic-style Weightlifting’</a
          >
          is one of the oldest sports which incorporates the use of two independent lifts which require the athlete to lift a loaded barbell from the floor to an overhead position in an explosive manner. The two lifts, the ‘Clean & Jerk’ and the ‘Snatch’ are
          explosive movements as they require a combination of maximal strength and maximal speed.

      <p>My name is Daniel Katzav, I was born in South Africa 1994. I achieved my Bcom Human Resources Management Degree from the University of Johannesburg.
        I have spent over 7 years in the Fitness industry before I decided to start Afrikan Beasts, to teach the sport of Olympic Weightlifting. I noticed the market in South Africa for Olympic Weightlifting schools/ gyms are very limited. To become more financially independent and help grow the sport I decided to take a leap and start my own Gym.
        I love to see the determination, the hard work and the success after the struggle and frustrations that come with learning and improving one’s techniques and personal bests. My passion to help people enjoy and feel comfortable with themselves along their fitness journey is what puts a smile to my face day in and day out.</p>
