### Bugs

- Initially had an issue with mobile device responsivness - the sizing of the video caused nav bar to strectch. Issue was fixed re-sizing and positioning videos using css styles.

- Background images for events section didn't load on deployed webisite, but were loading on local server. Issue was fixed changing the file path to relative instead of absolute.

- Some parts of top page content were hidden behing the nav bar, iniitially issue was fixed using margin-top property, however better solution was found later on - the diplay property for the nav-bar was changed from 'fixed' to 'sticky',that solved the issue.

- Techniques page section menu was not 'stuck'to the top of the page. A lot of CSS properties were tested and content changed for techniques page. The issue was easily fixed by moving the menu into header section and adding a few style properties, that achieved the desired outcome. 


### Unfixed bugs

- The section menu can't be styled on mobile devices as it takes too much space. For that reaon this menu is currently hidden on mobile devices. In the future this could be fixed adding burger menu using Javascript.
